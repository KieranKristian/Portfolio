                    This project features a large collection of agents with steering and flocking behaviours, that can be affected at runtime. It also features a predator/prey style demonstration.

                This project allowed me to greatly improve my skills in using C++ in unreal. I had to have agents all with steering and flocking behaviours that could be affected during runtime using widget UI elements that would link to the C++ agent classes. The steering behaviours used include: seek, flee, pursue, evade and arrival. The flocking behaviours include: cohesion, separation and alignment.<br><br>
                I learned a lota about debugging and optimisation during this project, having to complete a professional code report alongside my submission. This project necessitated strong optimisations so that I could have more agents in the simulation without it slowing significantly. <br><br>
                I also added a predator/prey style demonstration, with a cat on the floor that would chase after any pigeons that had gone to the ground to eat. This was a fun additional aspect of the project that meant I got to explore more steering behaviours such as pursue, evade and arrival.
