                    This project features a galaxy of stars that is generated at runtime. The stars have paths between them that can be travlled across by a spaceship, using a Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm.

                This project was really fun as I got to explore multiple different techniques throughout. The main one was the implementation of a Dijkstra pathfinding system, which would be able to find the shortest path between two different points. <br><br>
                This method also took into account alternative restrictions, such as having enemy territories which were more dangerous to travel to, you could also completely avoid these territories. There was also fuel which would limit the distance that the spaceship could travel. Ally territories would take half the amount of fuel to travel to than it normally would. <br><br>
                Another interesting topic I learned and implemented in this project was UI design. I had to make an easy to navigate UI that would also show information about the stars and the path that was generated.
