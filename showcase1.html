                    Odd Jobs was my first ever collaborative assignment for university, it was also my first time working in a group to make a game. Our efforts were rewarded with the opportunity to present our game at our university's end of year showcase.

                Being the only programmer in the group for this project presented a fun challenge, especially as this was my first experience working in a group. I was tasked with creating a physics based object carrying system for the game which was used in both of our levels that we created. The objects have to be carried by two people, otherwise the side of the object that wasnt being carried would remain stationary. <br><br>
                The system works by having configurable joints on two ends of an object. Each of these joints would then attach to a point on the player when interacted with, while also locking the player to the object so that the two wouldn't separate. This method means that picking up the one side of the object would mean that the other joint on the other side of the object would remain locked, so only the one end of the object would move. This resulted in a fun, scalable game mechanic that necessitated teamwork in order to complete the objectives. <br><br>
                This project also boosted my knowledge and experience in project management, as we had to use tools such as HackNPlan to plan out our project sprints as a group and also to delegate and keep track of work.
